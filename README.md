# Tutorials

A collection of tutorials used for teaching at workshops and university courses

### How to follow the tutorials

The main text includes all information needed to follow the exercises. Some additional information, discussion points or answers are hidden behind clickable sections (black triangles like the one below):

... and the additional information is revealed.

What is the additional information?

* "**Further background**" contains additional information to deepen the understanding, including links to publications and videos
* "**Optional**" are either further exercises that can be done for additional practice or alternative commands for locally installed software
* "**Answer**" or "**Hint"/"Help**": include hints or answers to a question. Please <ins>ONLY</ins> read if you really don't know what to do, if you cannot find an answer, or after you have answered the question to check if you are correct.
* "**Discussion points**" can help to start a discussion



![](./img/question_icon.png) The question icon indicates questions to be answered.

![](./img/discussion_icon.png) The discussion icon indicates questions/topics to be discussed with your neighbors.


Although ideally the activities are followed by using the produced output files again as input files in the next step, all materials (input and output files) are also provided. If the time to finish the activity is too short or something is not working as it should, the next step can always be followed by using the provided materials.

## Tutorials on phylogenetic inference
### Evolutionary Genetics lecture at the University of Basel (2021, 2022 – LV25600-01)

We will use online tools for many of the Activities. However, some softwares need to be downloaded and installed locally. Please go to [Software requirements](./software_requirements.md) and install the listed programs.


* Phylogenetics – an introduction (not covered here)

* [A research question (Background of activities)](./research_question/README.md)

* [Dataset compilation (Activity 1)](./dataset_compilation/README.md)

* [Multiple sequence alignment (Activity 2)](./multiple_sequence_alignment/README.md)

* [Substitution model selection (Activity 3)](./substitution_model_selection/README.md)

* [Maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference (Activity 4)](./maximum_likelihood_phylogenetic_inf/README.md)

* [Testing Markov chain Monte Carlo with the MCMC robot (Activity 5)](./mcmc_robot/README.md)

## Tutorials on population genomic analyses
### Workshop on Population and Speciation Genomics in Český Krumlov (2016, 2018, 2020)

These tutorials follow a slightly different style but still have question and answer options.

* [Quality control, quality filtering, and preparation of a population genomic dataset for downstream analyses](http://evomics.org/learning/population-and-speciation-genomics/2020-population-and-speciation-genomics/first-steps-in-genomic-data-analysis/)

	* [2020](http://evomics.org/learning/population-and-speciation-genomics/2020-population-and-speciation-genomics/first-steps-in-genomic-data-analysis/)
	* [2018](http://evomics.org/learning/population-and-speciation-genomics/2018-population-and-speciation-genomics/vcf-activity/) 
	* [2016](http://evomics.org/learning/population-and-speciation-genomics/2016-population-and-speciation-genomics/fileformats-vcftools-plink/)
