# A research question

## Objective

Determine when the family of Charadriidae (birds, including plovers, dotterels, and lapwings) arrived in New Zealand. The course uses phylogenetic methods to identify the timing and number of dispersal events. The sections below provide background and the rationale behind the questions.

## A little about the biogeographic history of New Zealand

New Zealand, consisting of two main islands, is part of the largely submerged continent Zealandia, which separated from Gondwana and Australia about 80 million years ago, drifting into the Pacific Ocean ([Video of continental breakup of Zealandia](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/videos/798-tectonic-plates)). This long geographical isolation has resulted in unique flora and fauna, characterized by high endemism, many flightless birds, and the absence of terrestrial mammals until human settlement in the 13th century. Jared Diamond (1990) described it as "as close as we will get to the opportunity to study life on another planet".

--------

Despite its isolation, New Zealand faced significant human-driven exploitation. Early settlers hunted large, slow-breeding species like Moas, geese, penguins, sea lions, and seals to extinction within a few centuries. Smaller animals, such as lizards, frogs, and birds, were preyed on by introduced Pacific rats (Kiore). Deforestation for habitation halved New Zealand's forest cover shortly after settlement.

The most severe environmental impacts came with European arrival 200 years ago. Endemic species face threats from deforestation and invasive plants and mammals. Ground-nesting and flightless birds are particularly vulnerable to predators like ferrets, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs, possums, dogs, and cats. In the last 700 years, around 50 bird species have gone extinct in New Zealand, a loss exceeded only by Hawai'i, where about 80 species have vanished, with many more critically endangered and expected to go extinct within the next years.

## Origin of the New Zealand fauna
 
The faunal biogeography of New Zealand is an area of active research with many unresolved questions. Key theories include **vicariance**, the splitting of species as landmasses separated, and **overwater dispersal**, which suggests species arrived via long-distance migration. Both theories explain the origins of many endemic species.

A recent review article by [Verry et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2022.2093227) provides a comprehensive summary of both previous and recent theories, offering new insights from ancient DNA research.

<a name="charadriidae"></a>
## New Zealand endemic species of dotterels and plovers

Today, **four endemic species** of dotterels and plovers, all part of the Charadriidae family in the order Charadriiformes ("shorebirds"), are found in New Zealand. 
Previous studies show that the Charadriiformes order is younger than the split between New Zealand and Australia, ruling out vicariance (speciation due to continental separation) as the origin of these endemic species. Therefore, at least one dispersal event must have occurred.

<details>
  <summary>Further background: The order Charadriiformes (click here)</summary>  

--------

The order Charadriiformes includes around 380 species from several families. Notable examples are:

* **Black-headed gull** (German: Lachmöwe) (*Chroicocephalus ridibundus*) commonly seen along the Rhine in Basel, especially in winter. 
* **Atlantic puffin** (German: Papageitaucher) (*Fratercula arctica*), known as "parrots" or "clowns of the sea."
* **Bar-tailed godwit** (German: Pfuhlschnepfe) (*Limosa lapponica*), holding the record for the longest non-stop migration (~12,000 km between Alaska and New Zealand in eight days).
* **Northern lapwing** (German: Kiebitz) (*Vanellus vanellus*), with its long head crest and iridescent plumage, found in the [Tierpark Lange-Erlen](https://www.erlen-verein.ch/) and the [Petite Camargue](https://www.birdingplaces.eu/en/birdingplaces/france/petite-camargue-alsacienne).
 
* New Zealand is home to **four endemic species**: 
	* **Wrybill** (German: Schiefschnabel) (*Anarhynchus frontalis*), the only species with a beak bent sideways to the right.
	* **Double-banded plover** (German: Doppelband-Regenpfeifer) (*Charadrius bicinctus*)
	* **New Zealand plover** or New Zealand dotterel (German: Maoriregenpfeifer) (*Charadrius obscurus*), and 
	* **Shore plover** or shore dotterel (German: Chathamregenpfeifer) (*Thinornis  novaeseelandiae*).  

Note that the genus *Charadrius* is not monophyletic – but see the most recent phylogeny of Charadriiformes [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107620), suggesting new taxonomic assignments.

A list of species that we will include in our phylogenetic analyses:
  
  
Species | Common name | Breeding distribution
:------ | :---------- | :------------------- 
*Anarhynchus frontalis* | Wrybill | **NZ endemic**
*Charadrius alexandrinus* | Kentish plover | Eurasia
*Charadrius australis* | Inland dotterel | AUS endemic
*Charadrius bicinctus* | Double-banded plover | **NZ endemic**
*Charadrius collaris* | Collared plover | South America
*Charadrius falklandicus* | Two-banded plover | South America
*Charadrius mongolus* | Lesser Sand plover | Asia
*Charadrius morinellus* | Eurasian dotterel | Eurasia
*Charadrius obscurus* | New Zealand plover | **NZ endemic**
*Charadrius semipalmatus* | Semipalmated plover | Americas
*Charadrius veredus* | Oriental plover | Asia
*Charadrius vociferus* | Killdeer | Americas
*Elseyornis melanops* | Black-fronted dotterel | Australia
*Oreopholus ruficollis* | Tawny-throated dotterel | South America
*Phegornis mitchellii* | Diademed plover | South America
*Pluvialis squatarola* | Grey plover | Arctic
*Thinornis novaeseelandiae* | Shore plover | **NZ endemic**
*Thinornis rubricollis/cucullatus* | Hooded dotterel | Australia
*Erythrogonys cinctus* | Red-kneed dotterel | Oceania
*Vanellus chilensis* | Southern lapwing | South America
*Vanellus Vanellus* | Northern lapwing | Eurasia
*Haematopus ater* | Blackish oystercatcher | Outgroup (South Am.)

The idea for the tutorial stems from [Barth et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078068) but for a recent Charadriiformes phylogeny refer to [Černýa and Natale, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107620).

## The research question

When did dotterels and plovers disperse to New Zealand? Was it a single or multiple events?

![](../img/discussion_icon.png) Take a few minutes to brainstorm with your neighbors. How could we investigate this question, and what data would be needed? 

If you're unsure, check the discussion points below.

--------

We will infer a **time-calibrated phylogeny** based on **molecular DNA sequences** sampled from the endemic New Zealand Charadriidae species, from sister species outside of New Zealand, and an outgroup to root the tree. The DNA sequences must represent **orthologous genomic regions** that originated through speciation events. We **align** the sequences to infer substitutions amongst them. The substitution rates will determine the **relative distances** between species, but to know the absolute timeline in years, we also need a **time-calibration** point in terms of fossil data, geographic events or other constraints. Finally, we will apply **maximum likelihood** and **Bayesian inference** methods to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships amongst Charadriidae and identify split and possible dispersal events.
