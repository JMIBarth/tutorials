# A research question

## Objective

When did the bird family of Charadriidae (including plovers, dotterels, and lapwings) arrive to the islands of New Zealand? In the following activities of this course we will use phylogenetic methods to identify the timing of dispersal and the number of dispersal events. In the sections below, some background and the rational behind the questions are laid out.

## A little about the biogeographic history of New Zealand

New Zealand, today consistent of two main islands, is part of the mostly submerged continent Zealandia that broke off Gondwana and Australia around 80 million years ago and drifted into the Pacific Ocean ([Video of continental breakup of Zealandia](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/videos/798-tectonic-plates)). It is this long geographical isolation that makes its flora and fauna so special: a very high rate of endemism, many flightless birds, and the absence of terrestrial mammals until human settlement in the 13th century. "New Zealand is as close as we will get to the opportunity to study life on another planet" (Jared Diamond 1990).

Yet, also New Zealand wasn't spared by human exploitation. The first settlers intensively hunted the larger, slower-breeding animals like Moas, geese, penguins, sea lions, and seals, which became extinct within a few hundred years. Smaller animals, lizards, frogs, birds were prayed on by introduced Kiore, the Pacific rat. Forest was burned to make the land more habitable and so New Zealand lost half of its forested area within a few hundred years after settlement.  
The most devastating environmental impact however had the Europeans after their arrival only some 200 years ago. Endemic flora and fauna is threatened by further deforestation and introduced plant and mammal species. Especially ground breeding and flightless birds have hardly any defense against introduced predators such as ferrets, stoats and weasels, hedgehogs, possums, dogs, and cats.  

There is an excellent (while a little lengthy) four parts 45-minutes each documentary series and a four parts 25-minutes each podcast series produced for Radio New Zealand (RNZ) highlighting New Zealands unique biodiversity and the desperate battle to protect it: [www.rnz.co.nz/wild](https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/fight-for-the-wild)

## Origin of the New Zealand fauna

The faunal biogeography of New Zealand is an actively researched topic that still leaves many open questions. Main theories including vicariance – the split of species with the separation of the land masses – as well as overwater dispersal have been put forward for many of the endemic species.

A recent review article focusing on new insights from ancient DNA research nicely summarizes previous and recent theories: [Verry et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2022.2093227)

## New Zealand endemic species of dotterels and plovers

Today, four endemic species of dotterels and plovers occur in New Zealand, all belonging to the family Charadriidae in the order Charadriiformes – the “shorebirds”.  
From previous studies we know that the whole order Charadriiformes is younger than the split of New Zealand from Australia, meaning that vicariance – the speciation simply due to the split of continents – can be excluded as origin of the endemic species. Thus, we also know that at least one dispersal event must have happened.

--------

About 380 species belonging to several families can be found in the order Charadriiformes. To pick some examples:

* The black-headed gull (*Chroicocephalus ridibundus*) that can also be observed along the Rhine in Basel and is especially abundand in the winter months 
* The charismatic Atlantic puffin (*Fratercula arctica*), also referred to as "parrots" or "clowns of the sea"
* The bar-tailed godwit, a species holding the record for the longest non-stop migration flight (~12,000 km between Alaska and New Zealand in eight days)
* The family Charadriidae, including the the northern lapwing with its long head crest and iridescent plumage, which you can observe in the [Tierpark Lange-Erlen](https://www.erlen-verein.ch/) in Basel or the [Petite Camargue](https://www.birdingplaces.eu/en/birdingplaces/france/petite-camargue-alsacienne) in Alsace, as well as the four New Zealand endemic species: the wrybill (*Anarhynchus frontalis*), the only species whose beak is always bent sideways to the right, the double-banded plover (*Charadrius bicinctus*), the New Zealand plover (*Charadrius obscurus*), and the shore plover (*Thinornis  novaeseelandiae*).  
Note that the genus *Charadrius* is not monophyletic – but see the most recent phylogeny of [Charadriiformes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107620)

A list of species that we will include in our phylogenetic analyses:

:------ | :---------- | :------------------- 
*Anarhynchus frontalis* | Wrybill | **NZ endemic**
*Charadrius alexandrinus* | Kentish plover | Eurasia
*Charadrius australis* | Inland dotterel | AUS endemic
*Charadrius bicinctus* | Double-banded plover | **NZ endemic**
*Charadrius collaris* | Collared plover | South America
*Charadrius falklandicus* | Two-banded plover | South America
*Charadrius mongolus* | Lesser Sand plover | Asia
*Charadrius morinellus* | Eurasian dotterel | Eurasia
*Charadrius obscurus* | New Zealand plover | **NZ endemic**
*Charadrius semipalmatus* | Semipalmated plover | Americas
*Charadrius veredus* | Oriental plover | Asia
*Charadrius vociferus* | Killdeer | Americas
*Elseyornis melanops* | Black-fronted dotterel | Australia
*Oreopholus ruficollis* | Tawny-throated dotterel | South America
*Phegornis mitchellii* | Diademed plover | South America
*Pluvialis squatarola* | Grey plover | Arctic
*Thinornis novaeseelandiae* | Shore plover | **NZ endemic**
*Thinornis rubricollis/cucullatus* | Hooded dotterel | Australia

*Vanellus chilensis* | Southern lapwing | South America
*Vanellus Vanellus* | Northern lapwing | Eurasia
*Haematopus ater* | Blackish oystercatcher | Outgroup (South Am.)

The idea for the tutorial stems from [Barth et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078068) but for a recent phylogeny of Charadriiformes, refer to [Černýa and Natale, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.107620).

## The research question

When did the endemic species of dotterels and plovers disperse to New Zealand? Did they disperse in one or several events?

![](../img/discussion_icon.png) Take a few minutes and discuss with you neighbours how we could investigate this question and what kind of data we would need to find an answer.

* Ancient DNA
* Phylogenetic inference

* Outgroup species and older sister taxa
* Time calibration point(s)
* Orthologs

  <summary>Our approach (click here)</summary> 

--------

We will infer a time-calibrated phylogeny based on molecular DNA sequences sampled from the endemic New Zealand Charadriidae species, from sister species outside of New Zealand, and an outgroup to root the tree. The DNA sequences must represent orthologous genomic regions that originated through speciation events. We align these sequences to infer substitutions amongst them. The substitution rates will determine the relative distances between species, but to know the absolute timeline in years, we also need a time-calibration point in terms of fossil data, geographic events or other constraints. Finally, we will apply maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships amongst Charadriidae and identify split and possible dispersal events.
