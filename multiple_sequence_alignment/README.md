# Multiple Sequence Alignment (Activity 2)

A tutorial on multiple sequence alignment (MSA)

## Objective

Learn how to generate a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and how to improve poorly aligned regions.
In Activity 1, we learned how to retrieve homologous sequences – the prerequisite to proceed to alignments – and how to prepare our dataset for analyses. In this second activity, we will align these sequences to trace the evolutionary past by matching similar regions that may share an evolutionary history.

## Align the 12s sequences using MAFFT

Go to the MAFFT alignment server: https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/. This site provides a web interface to the MAFFT alignment program (Katoh et al. 2002 Nucleic Acids Res), a popular multiple sequence aligner that implements progressive and iterative methods and also both the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman global and local alignment algorithms.

In case the web server is busy you may also download and install the MAFFT software (Standard package) on your computer: https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/

## Edit the alignment in an alignment viewer

Download the AliView alignment viewer program (Larsson 2014 Bioinf) from “http://ormbunkar.se/aliview/”, and install the program (Mac, Linux, and Windows versions available).
