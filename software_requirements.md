# Software requirement

We will use online tools for many of the Activities. However, some programs and softwares need to be downloaded and installed locally. Mac, Linux, and Windows versions are usually available. Please immediately test if the program opens/runs after the installation.

### Activity 1 and 2

*	**AliView** [AliView alignment viewer](http://ormbunkar.se/aliview) ([Larsson 2014 Bioinf](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu531))

* **BMGE** (Block Mapping and Gathering with Entropy ([Criscuolo & Gribaldo 2010 BMC Evol Biol](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-210)). Download BMGE using the command below in your Terminal: 
	`curl ftp://ftp.pasteur.fr/pub/gensoft/projects/BMGE/BMGE-1.12.tar.gz -o BMGE-1.12.tar.gz`

	Extract the content of the compressed tar.gz file using:
	`tar xvzf BMGE-1.12.tar.gz `

	Change the directory to the BMGE folder and test the program:
	`cd BMGE-1.12`  
	`java -jar BMGE.jar `

	If you see a line starting with `mandatory parameters: -i ‘infile’…` the software works.
	

### Activity 3 and 4

* **FigTree** by Andrew Rambaut. Download the [`.dmg`](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases/download/v1.4.4/FigTree.v1.4.4.dmg) for Mac users, [`.zip`](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases/download/v1.4.4/FigTree.v1.4.4.zip) for Windows, or [`.tgz`](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases/download/v1.4.4/FigTree_v1.4.4.tgz) for Linux.

### Activity 5 and 6

* **BEAST 2** – Go to the [BEAST 2 website](http://www.beast2.org/) and **download** the current BEAST 2 package (v2.7.1) according to your platform. The BEAST 2 package includes BEAUti, BEAST 2 itself, TreeAnnotator, and other tools. As all these programs are written in Java, compilation is not required, and they should work on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.

* **Tracer** – Download [Tracer](https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases) according to your platform ([Mac OS X](https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/download/v1.7.2/Tracer.v1.7.2.dmg), [Linux](https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/download/v1.7.2/Tracer_v1.7.2.tgz), or [Windows](https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/download/v1.7.2/Tracer.v1.7.2.zip)) Just like BEAST 2, Tracer is written in Java and should work on any system.

* **FigTree** To visualize and edit the tree, we will again use the program [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases/tag/v1.4.4). You should already have this software installed from the Maximum Likelihood tutorial. If not, download FigTree for [Mac OS X](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases/download/v1.4.4/FigTree.v1.4.4.dmg), [Linux](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases/download/v1.4.4/FigTree_v1.4.4.tgz), or [Windows](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases/download/v1.4.4/FigTree.v1.4.4.zip).
